# Predicting-Hospital-Readmission

This repository contains a predictive analytics term project for a graduate course, Predictive Analytics, at Bellevue University. The group members of this project were Sam Sears, Jolene Branch, and Andrea Fox. The goal of the project was to predict hospital readmissions for diabetic patients using the Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008).
